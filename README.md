# AutoJump plugin for space engineers

This client side plugin adds a toolbar action that can toggle a jump drive to jump automatically when charged. This can be useful when traveling long distances.

To install, you can select "AutoJump" from the Pulsar plugin list. If it's not there, you probably shouldn't install it anyway.

To use the plugin, simply add the new "AutoJump" action to your hotbar. Select a GPS target on your jump drive (or don't, I'm not your dad) and enable the "AutoJump" toggle. The ship should keep initiating jumps automatically until it reaches the target (or forever if you are blind jumping).

This project is based on the [client-plugin-template](https://github.com/viktor-ferenczi/se-client-plugin-template). Amazing stuff, it has made creating this plugin really easy.
